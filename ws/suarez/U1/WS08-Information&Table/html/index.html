                    In today's world, globalization has allowed us to be connected, receiving and sending information continuously. This flow of information has been modernized, along with digitalization, which had great growth during the COVID 19 pandemic. Many of the activities that were carried out in person were moved to the Internet. Actions such as ordering food, making payments and collections, or selling underwent a radical change, to such an extent that not being able to join the e-commerce business gives it a clear disadvantage compared to companies and businesses that can use this method to market their products, reaching more people both inside and outside the national territory. It is therefore necessary for merchants and small business owners to make this leap into the modern world. With this in mind, they seek to develop a website that allows local businesses to facilitate sales, optimize their profits, as well as provide them with the necessary tools to be competitive in the market.In today's world, globalization has allowed us to be connected, receiving and sending information continuously.
