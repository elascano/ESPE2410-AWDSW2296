    <strong>
        Once upon a time, there was a little girl who wore a beautiful red cape. Because the girl wore it very often, everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood.
        <br><br>
        With these words, the evil wolf threw off his blanket and jumped out of bed. Frightened, Little Red Riding Hood ran to the door. Just then, a woodcutter came to the door, which was half open. Grandma was hiding behind him.
        <br><br>
        Seeing the woodcutter, the wolf jumped out of the window and ran away, frightened, never to be seen again.
        <br><br>
        Grandma and Little Red Riding Hood thanked the woodcutter for saving them from the evil wolf, and they all ate cookies and milk. That day Little Red Riding Hood learned an important lesson:
        <br><br>
        “You should never talk to strangers.”

        I didn't want to be the one to forget
        I thought of everything I'd never regret
        A little time with you is all that I get
        That's all we need because it's all we can take
        One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
        I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground
        I wanna take you to that place in the Roche
        But no one gives us any time anymore
        He asks me once if I'd look in on his dog
        You made an offer for it, then you ran off
        I got this picture of us kids in my head
        And all I hear is the last thing that you said
        I listened to your problems, now listen to mine
