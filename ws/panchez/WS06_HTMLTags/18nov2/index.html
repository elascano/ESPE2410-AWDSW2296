		Most of the time, the full moon isn't perfectly full. 
		We always see the same side of the moon, 
		but part of it is in shadow,
		due to the moon's rotation.
		Only when the moon,
		Earth and the sun are perfectly aligned is the moon 100% full.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
		And sometimes once in a blue moon 
		the moon is full twice in a month (or four times in a season,
		depending on which definition you prefer).
