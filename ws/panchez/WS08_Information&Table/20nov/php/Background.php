                <h3>The Early Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2005, MADECOR started as a small artisan workshop focused on creating wooden toys for local communities. Inspired by Montessori education, the initial products were designed to help children develop motor and cognitive skills while having fun. Soon, the brand gained recognition for its unique designs and high-quality materials.

                        <p>
                            Over the years, MADECOR expanded its offerings to include children's furniture such as desks, ergonomic chairs, and storage systems, ideal for creating educational environments at home and in classrooms. Additionally, construction sets, puzzles, and educational figures were introduced, becoming essential tools for interactive learning.

                <h3>Innovation and Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2015, MADECOR took a leap into digitization by introducing an online inventory and sales management system. This system allowed customers to access a virtual catalog where they could explore products, place orders, and receive updates on availability. At the same time, the company adopted sustainable practices, ensuring that all materials were environmentally friendly.
