        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>MADECOR needs a system that allows it to manage its wooden educational materials
            inventory in an automated and digital way, to improve stock control and facilitate the sale of
            these products to its customers online. Currently, MADECOR uses a traditional paper-based
            method to record its stock, which is inefficient and increases the risk of errors in inventory
            management.
            <br>
            <br>
            To understand what the system must do, it is important to consider the key aspects of the
            wooden educational materials inventory, the stock update process, and direct sales to the end
            customer. This system must also offer a web interface accessible from any device, where
            customers can view a digital catalog, select products, and complete their orders through a
            shopping cart. We will focus on developing basic inventory, product catalog, and online sales
            management functionalities, simplifying purchasing operations for customers and
            management for administrators</p>
