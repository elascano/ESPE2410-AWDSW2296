        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>MADECOR is a company that manufactures and distributes wooden educational materials,
            stories such as building blocks, puzzles and educational figures. For years, MADECOR has
            operated with traditional methods for managing its inventory, using only paper records. Each
            manufactured product is recorded in notebooks, noting the quantity available and outputs to
            fulfill orders from distributors and retailers. However, this manual system is prone to errors
            and makes decision-making difficult, such as stock control and sales tracking.
            <br>
            <br>
            In today's market, distributors and educators need quick access to information about
            educational products. The lack of a digitalized system and an online platform limits
            MADECOR's reach, making it difficult to both internal inventory control and customer
            access to an updated product catalog. To solve this, it is proposed to implement a web-based
            inventory and sales management system that facilitates inventory consultation and the
            purchasing process.
            <br>
            <br>
            This digital system includes an online catalog where customers will be able to view products,
            select the necessary quantities, and place orders through a shopping cart. In addition, the
            system will allow MADECOR managers to automatically update inventory when sales are
            made and receive alerts when stock levels are low. Products will be identified by specific
            codes, and each sales transaction will include details about the product, quantity, transaction
            date, and sales price.
