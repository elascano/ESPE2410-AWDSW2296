        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>In the field of education and learning, wooden educational materials offer distributors and
            educators essential resources to support children's cognitive and motor development.
            MADECOR, a company specializing in the manufacture of these materials, has traditionally
            operated without a digital system, limiting itself to the use of paper records to keep track of
            inventory. However, in recent years, MADECOR has recognized the importance of
            modernizing its processes to make it easier for its customers to acquire products and improve
            internal efficiency.
            <br>
            <br>
            To achieve these goals, it seeks to implement a digital system that automates inventory
            management and allows its customers to access an online catalog with purchasing functions.
            This system will not only optimize stock control and reduce errors, but will also increase the
            company's visibility in the market, facilitating direct purchasing through a web platform
            accessible from any device</p>
